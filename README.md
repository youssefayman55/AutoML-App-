# AutoML-App
# ðŸš€ Streamlit Application for Automated ML Model Training ðŸŒŸ

In this project, I built a dynamic web app using Streamlit that allows users to automate the process of selecting, training, and evaluating machine learning models. Users can upload datasets, choose from multiple models (Logistic Regression, SVC, Random Forest, XGBoost), and preprocess the data with different scaling methods. The app simplifies the entire pipeline from data preprocessing to model evaluation, providing instant feedback on model performance through accuracy scores.
